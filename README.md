# CIIRC - Cybersecurity Incident & Intrusion Response Competition

## What is CIIRC?

This is an **Incident Response Competition** hosted by Baylor University where teams detect and remediate a simulated cyberattack within a business environment. The scripts and code found in this repository are made for simulating redteam activity to test the teams ability to respond. In 2024 it was heavily script based with misconfigured SSH permissions. In 2025 the attack was more detailed, abusing multiple avenues such as Kerboroasting, insecure script permissions to allow for the deployment of c2 software, and abusing CVE‑2025‑32463 obtain root access to the network.
